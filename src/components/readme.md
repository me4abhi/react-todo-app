The 'components' folder in the simple folder structure is incredibly straightforward since it will contain every single component in your entire application.

Now, obviously as your project grows beyond 10-15 components, this folder can become incredibly unruly to deal with which is why in all other folder structures our components are spread across multiple folders and given more structure.

For a small project (like this one), this added complexity is not needed and a single folder is fine.

`TO FIX`
=> Setting header width to 100% results in overflow.
=> Set input_task component's size to be in coherence with other components. (check responsiveness with very small screens in Chrome Devtools)



`FURTHER MODIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE DONE`

=> Limit the lines of text displayed (in case task description is too long) in the tasks_card component.

=> Add a time limit for task to be completed.

=> Add alarm for task reminders.
